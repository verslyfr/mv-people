# models/yolov3-tiny.weights - Keeping this in git as it is < 50MB and required for the app.
# We might want to keep the config but ignore the heavy weights file? 
# The code expects models/yolov3-tiny.weights. 
# If it's a large file (likely), it shouldn't be in git unless using LFS.
# For now I will ignore the weights file.
